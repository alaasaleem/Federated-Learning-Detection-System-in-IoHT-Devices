# Cyber-Attack Detection System for Internet of Health Things (IoHT) Devices Using Federated Learning
With the growing volume of sensitive data transmitted through IT infrastructures, healthcare organizations and companies that generate user wearable data have become prime targets for cyber-attacks. To safeguard electronic healthcare data, Internet of Health Things (IoHT) devices must be protected by robust Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to ensure a secure environment. However, due to regulations and policies, hospitals and organizations are restricted from sharing patient data for running IDSs to detect cyber-attacks in IoHT traffic. As a result, it is not feasible to collect patient data and develop IDSs using machine learning (ML) directly. In this context, federated learning (FL) offers a solution to enhance privacy without significantly compromising detection accuracy. Unlike the centralized paradigm of traditional ML models, FL is a privacy-aware ML framework designed to analyze data without sharing it.

This project aims to address the data privacy challenge and provide a more secure environment for patientsâ€™ private data. Students will investigate the design of an ML-based FL architecture to detect anomalies in IoHT traffic without compromising patient data. They will also explore the development of a decentralized ML model in federated learning (ML-FL model), including (i) Support Vector Machines (SVM), (ii) Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN), (iii) Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and (iv) Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units. Specifically, the ML-FL model will act as a classifier for each client and will analyze network traffic to detect various cyber-attacks, such as spoofing attacks, data alteration, ARP spoofing, DoS attacks, NMAP port scans, and smurf attacks. Additionally, students will investigate the effectiveness of ML-FL models and compare their performance with centralized ML models in terms of prediction accuracy. This project will not only enhance students' understanding of ML/FL and cybersecurity but also contribute to the development of more robust IDSs for e-healthcare.
