this environment like that:
attacker: kali linux
victim: ubuntu linux
ai model: vs code in windows
----------------------------
attacker code: attacks.py
change this ips according to victim IP, for example: victim ip is 192.168.x.y
- target_ip = "192.168.x.y"
- broadcast_ip = "192.168.x.255"
- spoofed_ip = "192.168.x.1"
----------------------------- 
before run the codes you must do shared folder between (test_dataset) folder and ubuntu, ask ghatGPT for it 
------------------------------
to run all codes togather folow these steps:
1. run vs code
2. run victim code
3. run attacker code
